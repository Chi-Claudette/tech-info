<h2> History of computers</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="com hist.jpg" width="700px" height="450px" class="img-fluid"></div>
<br>
<p>The history of computer  began during the period of scientific revolution (1543 to 1678). The calculating machine invented by <b>Blaise Pascal in 1642</b> and that of <b>Goffried Liebnits</b> marked the  begining of the application of machine in industry. This progressed up to the period 1760 to 1830 which was the period of the industrial revolution in Great Britain where the use of machine for production altered the  British  society and  the Western world.  During this period  Joseph Jacquard invented the weaving loom, which is a machine used in textile industry.</p>
<p>While today we use computers for both work and entertainment, the computer was actually created for an entirely different purpose. In 1880, the population of the United States had grown so large that it took seven years to formulate the results of the U.S. Census.
So, the government looked for a faster way to get the job done, which is why punch-card computers were invented that took up an entire room.</p>
<p>Today, we carryout more computing power on our smart phones than was available in these early models. The  following brief history  of computing is  a timeline of  how computers evolved from their humble beginnings to the machines of today that surf the internet, play games, stream multimedia and lots more.</p>
<h3>  Historical events of computer</h3>
<ul>
<li><b> 1623:</b> Wilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator.</li>
<br>
<li><b> 1673:</b> Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator called the Stepped  Reckoner.  He  may  be  considered  the  first  computer  scientist  and information theorist, for among other reasons, documenting the binary number system.</li>
<br>
<li><b>1801:</b>  In  France,  Joseph  Marie  Jacquard  invented a  loom  that  used  punched wooden cards  to automatically weave  fabric designs.  Early computers  would use similar punch cards.</li>
<br>
<li><b> 1820:</b> Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he released his simplified arithmometer, which was the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment.</li>
<br>
<li><b>1822:</b> English mathematician <b>Charles Babbage (Father of Computer)</b> conceived  a steam-driven calculating machine that would be able to compute tables of numbers. The project, funded by the English government, was a failure. More than a century later, however, the world's first computer was actually built.</li>
<br>
<li><b> 1843:</b> During the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer.</li>
<br>
<li><b>1885:</b>  Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of IBM.</li>
<br>
<li><b> 1890:</b>  Herman  Hollerith  designs a  punch  card  system  to calculate  the 1880 census, accomplishing the task in just three years and saving the government $5 million. He established a company that would ultimately become IBM.  </li>
<br>
<li><b> 1936:</b> Alan Turing presents the notion of a universal machine, later called the Turing machine, capable of computing anything that is computable. The central concept of the modern computer was based on his ideas. </li>
<br>
<li><b>1937:</b>  J.V.  Atanasoff, a  professor  of physics  and  mathematics at  Iowa  State University, attempts to build  the first computer without gears, cams,  belts or shafts.</li>
<br>
<li><b> 1937:</b>  One  hundred years  after  Babbage's  impossible  dream,  Howard  Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was  also  in  the  calculator  business  to  develope  his  giant  programmable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. When the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true"</li>
<br>
<li><b> 1939:</b> Hewlett-Packard is founded by David Packard and Bill Hewlett in a Palo Alto, California, garage, according to the Computer History Museum.  </li>
<br>
<li><b> 1941:</b> Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, design a computer that can solve 29 equations simultaneously. This marks the first time a computer is able to store information on its main memory.</li>
<br>
<li><b> 1943-1944:</b> Two University of Pennsylvania professors, John Mauchly and J. Presper  Eckert,  build  the  Electronic  Numerical  Integrator  and  Calculator (ENIAC). Considered the grandfather of digital computers, it fills a 20-foot by 40-foot room and has 18,000 vacuum tubes.</li>
<br>
<li><b> 1946:</b> Mauchly and Presper leave the University of Pennsylvania and receive funding from the Census  Bureau to build the UNIVAC, the  first commercial computer for business and government applications.</li>
<br>
<li><b>  1947:</b> William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain of Bell Laboratories invent the transistor. They discovered how to make an electric switch with solid materials and no need for a vacuum.</li>
<br>
<li><b>  1953:</b> Grace Hopper  develops the first  computer language, which  eventually becomes known  as COBOL.  Thomas Johnson  Watson Jr.,  son of  IBM CEO Thomas Johnson Watson Sr., conceives the IBM 701 EDPM to help the United Nations keep tabs on Korea during the war. </li>
<br>
<li><b> 1954:</b>  The  FORTRAN  programming  language,  an  acronym  for  FORmula TRANslation,  is  developed  by  a  team of  programmers  at  IBM  led  by  John Backus, according to the University of Michigan.</li>
<br>
<li><b>1958:</b> Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce unveil the integrated circuit, known as the computer chip. Kilby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for his work. </li>

<li><b> 1964:</b> Douglas Engelbart shows  a  prototype of the modern  computer, with a mouse and a  graphical user interface (GUI). This  marks the evolution of  the computer  from  a  specialized  machine  for  scientists  and  mathematicians  to technology that is more accessible to the general public.</li>
<br>
 <li><b> 1969:</b> A group of developers at Bell Labs produce UNIX, an operating system that addressed  compatibility issues. Written  in the C  programming language, 
  UNIX was portable across multiple platforms and became the operating system of choice among mainframes at large companies and government entities. Due to the slow nature of the system, it never quite gained traction among home PC users. </li>
  <br>
 <li><b> 1970:</b> The newly formed Intel unveils the Intel 1103, the first Dynamic Access Memory (DRAM) chip. </li>

On April 4, after the success of this first endeavor,  the  two  childhood  friends  form  their  own  software  company, Microsoft.  </li>
 <br>
  <li><b> 1976:</b> Steve  Jobs and  Steve Wozniak start  Apple Computers  on April  Fool's Day and  roll out the  Apple I,  the  first computer  with a single-circuit  board, according to Stanford University.   1977: Radio Shack's initial production run of the TRS-80 was just 3,000. It sold like  crazy.  For  the  first  time,  non-geeks  could  write programs  and  make  a computer do what they wished.</li>

  <p>The history of computer is considered with the generations of a  computer from first generation to fifth generation.</p>
  <h2> Generations of Computer</h2>
  	<p>A generation of computers refers to the specific improvements in computer technology with time. In 1946, circuits were developed to perform the counting. It replaced the gears and other mechanical parts used for counting in previous computing machines.</p>
  		<p>In each new generation, the circuits became smaller and more advanced than the previous generation circuits. The small size helped increase the speed, memory and power of computers. The five generations of computers  are described below;</p>
  		<h3>1. First Generation Computers (1946 to 1959)</h3>
  		<img src="fg.jpg " width="400px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
  		<p>The first generation computers were slow, huge and expensive. In these computers, vacuum tubes were used as the basic components of CPU and memory. These computers were mainly depended on batch operating system and punch cards. Magnetic tape and paper tape were used as output and input devices in this generation. Some of the popular first generation computers are;</p>
  		<ul>
  			<li>EDVAC ( Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer)</li>
  			<li>ENIAC ( Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)</li>
  			<li>UNIVACI ( Universal Automatic Computer)</li>
  			<li>IBM -701 (International Business Machine</li>
  			<li>IBM -650</li>

  		</ul>
  <h3>2. Second Generation Computers (1959 to 1965)</h3>
  <img src="sg.jpg " width="400px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
  <p>The second generation  was the era of the transistor computers. These computers used transistors which were cheap, compact and consuming less power; it made transistor computers faster than the first generation computers.
In this generation, magnetic cores were used as the primary memory and magnetic disc and tapes were used as the secondary storage. Assembly language and programming languages like COBOL and FORTRAN, and Batch processing and multiprogramming operating systems were used in these computers.Some of the popular second generation computers are;</p>
<ul>
	<li>IBM 1620</li>
	<li>IBM 7094</li>
	<li>CDC 1604</li>
	<li>CDC 3600</li>
	<li>UNIVAC 1108</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.Third Generation of Computers(1965 to 1971)</h3>
<img src="tg.jpg " width="400px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
<p>The third generation computers used integrated circuits (ICs) instead of transistors. A single IC can pack huge number of transistors which increased the power of a computer and reduced the cost. The computers also became more reliable, efficient and smaller in size. These generation computers used remote processing, time-sharing, multi programming as operating system. Also, the high-level programming languages like FORTRON-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, ALGOL-68 were used in this generation.
Some of the popular third generation computers are;</p>
<ul>
	<li>IBM-360 series</li>
	<li>Honeywell-6000 series</li>
	<li>PDP(Personal Data Processor)</li>
	<li>IBM-370/168</li>
	<li>TDC-316</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Fourth Generation Computers (1971 to 1980)</h3>
<img src="fog.jpg " width="400px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
<p>The fourth generation computers used very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits; a chip containing millions of transistors and other circuit elements. These chips made this generation computers more compact, powerful, fast and affordable. These generation computers used real time, time sharing and distributed operating system. The programming languages like C, C++, DBASE were also used in this generation.
Some of the popular fourth generation computers are;</p>
<ul>
	<li>DEC 10</li>
	<li>STAR 1000</li>
	<li>PDP 11</li>
	<li>CRAY-1(Super Computer)</li>
	<li>CRAY-X-MP(Super Computer)</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Fifth Generation Computers (1980 till date)</h3>
<img src="fig.jpg " width="400px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
<p>In fifth generation computers, the VLSI technology was replaced with ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration). It made possible the production of microprocessor chips with ten million electronic components. This generation computers used parallel processing hardware and AI (Artificial Intelligence) software. The programming languages used in this generation were C, C++, Java, .Net, etc.
Some of the popular fifth generation computers are;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Desktop</li>
	<li>Laptop</li>
	<li>NoteBook</li>
	<li>UltraBook</li>
