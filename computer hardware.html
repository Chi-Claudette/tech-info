<h1>What is Computer Hardware ?</h1>
<p>Computer hardware is a collective term used to describe any of the physical components of an analog or digital computer. This distinguishes it from software, which consists of written instructions that tell the physical components what to do. Without any hardware, your computer would not exist, and software could not be used. Computer hardware may sometimes be seen abbreviated as computer HW. </p>
<p>The components that make up hardware can be categorized as being either internal or external. Internal components are those installed inside the computer. External components are connected to the outside of the computer, they can also be referred to as peripherals, or peripheral devices.</p>
<h2>Internal hardware components</h2>
<p>Below is a list of hardware components found inside a computer.</p>
<h3>1. Motherboard</h3>
<br>
<img src="mb.jpg" height="400px" width="600px"  class=" img-fluid ">
	<p>A motherboard is an electronic circuit board in a computer which interconnects hardware devices attached to it. It can be thought of as the "mother" that holds all the pieces together. It allocates power to all hardware located on it and enables them to communicate with each other. It is meant to hold the computer's microprocessor chip and let other components connect to it. Each component that runs the computer or improves its performance is  part of the motherboard or connected to it through a slot or port.</p>
	<p>Components of a motherboard include;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>CPU slot</li>
		<li>RAM slot</li>
		<li>Expansion slot</li>

	</ul>
	<h3>2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
	<img src="cpu.jpg" height="400px" width="400px"  class=" img-fluid ">
	<p>It is the electronic circuitry within a computer that  exercutes instructions that make up a computer program. It performs basic arithmetic, logic,  controlling, and input/output operations specified by the instructions in the program. It  performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function, and is sometimes referred to as the “brain” of the computer. Each CPU has a clock speed, which is the number of instructions it can process in any given second, measured in gigahertz. </p>
	<p>Intel and AMD are the two most popular CPU manufacturers for desktops, laptops, and servers, while Apple, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm are big smartphone and tablet CPU makers. </p>
	<h3>3. Random Acess Memory (RAM)</h3>
	<img src="ram.jpg" height="400px" width="400px"  class=" img-fluid ">
	<p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is the physical hardware inside a computer that temporarily stores data, serving as the computer's "working" memory.  As the main memory of a computer, RAM is much faster to read from and write to than other types of storage, including a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) and optical drive. RAM is volatile, which means that data stays in RAM if the computer is on, but it's lost when the computer is turned off.</p>
	<p> It is normally found in the memory slots of the motherboard. Generally speaking, the faster the RAM, the faster the processing speed at which memory moves data to other components. Some popular manufacturers of RAM include Kingston, PNY, Crucial, and CORSAIR. </p>
	<h3>4. Power Supply</h3>
	<img src="power supply.jpg" height="400px" width="400px"  class=" img-fluid ">
	<p>The power supply unit is the piece of hardware that converts the power provided from the outlet into usable power for the many parts inside the computer case. It  converts  alternating current to direct current that the  computer components require.  It also regulates the voltage to an adequate amount, which allows the computer to run smoothly without overheating. Typically, more power is needed to run more complex systems.</p>
	<h3>5. Video card</h3>
	<img src="video memory.jpg" height="400px" width="400px"  class=" img-fluid ">
	<p>Video card  is an expansion card that enables the computer to send output images to a video display device such as a monitor,TV, or projector. The video card typically installs through a slot on the motherboard. It is  also known as a display adapter, graphics card, video adapter, video board, or video controller.   </p>
	<p>Video cards are used by gamers in place of integrated graphics due to their extra processing power and video ram.  A staggering number of companies manufacture video cards, but almost every one includes a graphics processing unit (GPU) from either NVIDIA Corporation or AMD.
</p>
	<h3>6. Hard Drive(HDD)</h3>
	<img src="hard drive.jpg" height="400px" width="400px"  class=" img-fluid ">
	<p>The hard disk drive is the main data storage device of a computer. The operating system, software titles, and most other files are stored in the hard disk drive.The hard drive is sometimes referred to as the "C drive" because Microsoft Windows, by default, designates the "C" drive letter to the primary partition on the primary hard drive in a computer. Unlike RAM, hard drives are non-volatile, which means that they maintain their stored data even when powered off.</p>
<h3>7. Solid State Drive(SSD)</h3>
<img src="ssd.jpg" height="400px" width="400px"  class=" img-fluid ">
<p>A type of nonvolatile storage device that stores persistent data on solid-state flash memory. Unlike a hard drive, an SSD has no moving parts, which gives it advantages, such as faster access time, noiseless operation, higher reliability, and lower power consumption.</p>
<h3>8. Optical Drive</h3>
<img src="optical drive.jpg" height="400px" width="400px"  class=" img-fluid ">
<p>An optical disc drive (ODD) uses laser light or electromagnetic waves to read or write data onto optical discs. This type of drive allows a user to retrieve, edit and delete the content from optical disks such as CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray disks. The optical drive normally goes by other names like a disc drive, CD drive, DVD drive, or BD drive.   </p>
<h3>9. Card Reader</h3>
<img src="card reader.jpg" height="400px" width="400px"  class=" img-fluid ">
<p>Also known as a media card reader is a  hardware device for reading and writing data on a memory card such as a multimedia card. Some card readers only have one card slot, and some have multiple card slots for different cards and media.  Most card readers accept multiple memory card formats, including compact flash (CF), secure digital (SD), and Sony's Memory Stick. Some card readers accept various other formats such as XD, SmartMedia, Microdrive, and Memory Stick Pro Duo cards.</p>
<p>It mostly find use for those who want to download information from expanded storage on a smartphone, or memory from a digital camera.</p>
