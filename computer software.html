<h1>What is Computer Software?</h1>
<p>Software is a set of programs that enables the hardware to perform a specific task. It is abbreviated as  'SW'. All the programs that run the computer are software. A program is a sequence of instructions written to solve a particular problem.  Software is an intangible resource. You can’t hold it in your hands, While Hardware consists of tangible resources such as mice, keyboards, USB ports, CPUs, memory, printers, and so on. </p>
<p>There are two major types of software:</p>
<ul>
	<li>System software</li>
	<li>Application software</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Sytem Software</h2>
<p>System software is a collection of programs designed to helps the user, hardware, and application software to interact and function together. System software creates an environment or platform for other software and applications to work in. It is the main software that runs the computer. When you turn on the computer, it activates the hardware and controls and coordinates their functioning. It serves as the interface between the end user and the hardware.</p>
<p>System software is generally prepared by the computer manufacturers. These software products comprise of programs written in low-level languages, which interact with the hardware at a very basic level. Types of system software include;</p>
<h3>i) Operating System</h3>
<img src="os.jpg" width="400px" height="500px" class="img-fluid">
<br>
	<p>Operating system is a collection of software that manages resources and provide common services for other software that runs "on top" of it. It is the system software that works as an interface to enable the user to communicate with the computer. Every device, whether a desktop, laptop or mobile phone requires an operating system to provide the basic functionality to it. There are various types of operating system such as real-time, embedded, distributed, multiuser, single-user, internet, mobile, and many more. It is important to consider the hardware specifications before choosing an operating system</p>
	<p>For desktops computers, laptops and tablets, the types of operating systems used are;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Microsoft windows</li>
		<li>Mac (For apple devices only)</li>
		<li>Linux</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For smartphones, the types of operating systems used are;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Google's Android</li>
		<li>Apple's iOS</li>
		<li>Windows phone OS</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>ii) Utility</h3>
	<img src="utility.jpg" width="500px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
	<br>
	<p>Utility software manages the performance of your hardware and application software installed on your computer, to ensure they work optimally. It provides support to the computer infrastructure. Examples of utility software include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Disk cleaner (eg CCleaner)</li>
	<li>Data backup software(eg Norton ghost )</li>
	<li>File compressor (eg  WinRAR )</li>
	<li>Antivirus and security software (eg Norton antivirus )</li>
	<li>Disk defragmentation software (eg  Defraggler)</li>
</ul>
<h3>iii) Device drivers</h3>
<br>
<img src="dd.jpg"  width="400px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
<p>It is a special kind of software that controls a specific hardware device attached to the system. Device drivers are essential for a computer to work properly. A device driver usually communicates with the hardware by means of the communications subsystem or computer bus to which the hardware is connected.  A device driver acts as a translator between the hardware device and the programs or operating systems that use it.  Hardware devices that need a driver to connect to a system include displays, sound cards, printers, mice and hard disks.</p>
<p>Examples of device drivers;</p>
<ul>
	
        <li>BIOS Driver</li>
        <li>Display Drivers</li>
        <li>Motherboard Drivers</li>
        <li>Printer Drivers</li>
        <li>ROM Drivers</li>
        <li>Sound card Driver</li>
        <li>USB Drivers</li>
        <li>USB Drivers</li>
        <li>VGA Drivers</li></li>
       <li> VGA Drivers</li>
       <li> Virtual Device Drivers</li>

</ul>
<h3>iv) Firmware</h3>
<p>Firmware is a permanent software which is embedded in the system’s read-only memory. It is a set of instructions which are permanently stored onto the hardware device. It offers vital information regarding how a particular device interacts with different other hardware. Some examples of firmware include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Embedded Systems</li>
	<li>BIOS</li>
	<li>UEFI</li>
	<li>Computer Peripherals</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Application Software</h2>
<br>
<img src="as.png" width="400px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
<br>
<p>Application software is a set of programs designed to perform a specific task. Application software may consist of a single program, such as Microsoft's notepad for writing and editing a simple text. It may also consist of a collection of programs, often called a software package, which work together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet package. Applications on a computer cannot run on their own; they require a computer's OS, along with other supporting system software programs, to work.</p>
<p>They are also known as end-user programs or even productivity programs designed for  a specific function. These software are often developed through custom software development, based on the requirements of the users. Examples of application software include:

</p>
<h3>i) Word processors</h3>
<p>This software allows users to create, edit, format, and manipulate the text and more. It offers lots of options for writing documents, creating images, and more. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>MS Word </li>
	<li>Apple iWork-Pages</li>
	<li>Google docs</li>
	<li>Corel WordPerfect</li>
</ul>
<h3>ii) Web browsers</h3>
<p>These applications are used to browse the internet. They help the user in locating and retrieving data across the web. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Google chrome</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer</li>
	<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
	<li>UC Browser</li>
	<li>Safari</li>
</ul>
<h3>iii) Database software</h3>
<p>his software is used to create and manage a database. They organize data in the database. It is  also called a Database Management System(DBMS). Examples if DBMS incllude:</p>
<ul>
	<li>MySQL</li>
	<li>FileMaker</li>
	<li>MS Access</li>
	<li>FoxPro</li>
	<li>Clipper</li>
</ul>
<h3>iv) Multimedia software</h3>
<p>It is a software that is use to play, create or record images, audio or video files. These software are used for animation, video editing, graphics as well as image editing. Due to the high demand for such software, every software product development company has vast avenues in developing them. Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
	<li>Windows Movie Maker</li>
	<li>Picasa</li>
	<li>VLC Media Player</li>
</ul>
<p> Other types of software include:</p>
<h3>A) Programming Software</h3>
<img src="prog soft.jpg" width="400px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
<br>
<p>It is a  collection of tools that help developers in writing other software or programs. It assists them in creating, debugging, and maintaining software or programs or applications. It translate programming language such as Java, C++, Python, etc., into machine language code. So, it is not used by end-users. For example, compilers, linkers, debuggers, interpreters, text editors. Examples of programming software include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Sublime text:</b> It is a cross-platform code editor for Linux, Mac, and Windows.</li>
	<li><b>Coda:</b> It is a programming language editor for Mac.</li>
	<li><b>Eclipse:</b> It is a java language editor.</li>
	<li><b>Notepad++:</b> It is an open-source editor for windows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>B) Middleware</h3>
<br>
<img src="mid.png" width="400px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
<br>
<p>The term middleware describes software that mediates between application and system software or between two different kinds of application software. For example, middleware enables Microsoft Windows to talk to Excel and Word. Data management, application services, messaging, authentication, and API management are all commonly handled by middleware. Middleware helps developers build applications more efficiently. It acts like the connective tissue between applications, data, and users. Examples of middleware include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Game engine:</b> Game engine middleware is more helpful for game developers with accessing to different kinds of tools which help to make game process easier. For examples are game scripting, physics simulations, and graphics rendering.</li>
	<li><b>Integration middleware:</b>This middleware helps to deliver better integration framework, and with the help of it various operations, executions and runtime services can be determined and handled from various apps.</li>
	<li><b>Device middleware:</b>This middleware helps to deliver group of tools which are implemented to develop various applications, and they can be run in particular hardware environment.</li>
</ul>
