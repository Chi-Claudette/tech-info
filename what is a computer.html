<h1>What is a computer ?</h1>
<p>A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw data as input and processes it with a set of instructions (program) to produce the result as output. It produces output just after performing mathematical and logical operations and can save the output for future use. It can process numerical as well as non-numerical calculations. The term "computer" is derived from the Latin word "computare" which means to calculate.</p>
<p>Every digital computer carries out these five functions;</p>
<ol>
	<li>Take data as input</li>
	<li>Stores the data/instructions in its memory and uses them as required.</li>
	<li>Processes the data and converts it into useful information.</li>
	<li>Generates the output.</li>
	<li>Controls all the above four steps.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Basic parts needed for a computer to  work</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Processor:</b> It executes instructions from software and hardware.</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Memory:</b> It is the primary memory for data transfer between the CPU and storage.</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Motherboard:</b> It is the part that connects all other parts or components of a computer.</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Storage Device:</b> It permanently stores the data, e.g, hard drive.</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Input Device:</b> It allows you to communicate with the computer or to input data, e.g, a keyboard.</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Output Device:</b> It enables you to see the output, e.g, monitor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, computers make jobs that used to be complicated much simpler. For example, you can write a letter in a word processor, edit it anytime, spell check, print copies, and send it to someone across the world in seconds. All these activities would have taken someone days, if not months, to do before. Also, these examples are a small fraction of what computers can do.</p>
<h2>Types of computers</h2>
<P>Computers come in a variety of types designed for different purposes, with different capabilities and costs.</P>
<ol>
	<li>Micro computer</li>
	<li>Mini computer</li>
	<li>Mainframe computer</li>
	<li>Super computer</li>
	<li>Workstation</li>
</ol>
<br>
	<h3>1. Micro Computer</h3>
	<br>
	<br>
	<img src="micro comp.jpg" width="500px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
	<p>A microcomputer is a computer that has a microprocessor chip (or multiple microprocessors) as its CPU. They are more commonly called personal computers because they are designed to be used by one person at a time. Personal computers are typically used at home, at school, or at a business.</p>
	<p>The first microcomputer was built with 8-bit microprocessor chips. The common examples of microcomputers include laptops, desktop computers, personal digital assistant (PDA), tablets, and smartphones. Popular uses for microcomputers include word processing, surfing the Web, sending and receiving e-mail, spreadsheet calculations, editing photographs, creating graphics, database management and playing music or games.</p>
	<h3>2. Mini Computer</h3>
	<br>
	<br>
	<img src="mini comp.jpg" width="500px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
	<p>A minicomputer is a multi-user computer that is less powerful than a mainframe. So, they are generally used by small businesses and firms. Individual departments of a company use these computers for specific purposes. This class of computers became available in the 1960’s when large scale integrated circuits made it possible to build a computer much cheaper than the then existing mainframes.</p>
	<h3>3. Mainframe  Computers</h3>
	<br>
	<img src="main comp.jpg" width="500px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
	<p>A mainframe computer is a large, powerful computer that handles the processing for many users simultaneously (up to  hundreds of users). Users connect to the mainframe using terminals and submit their tasks for processing by the mainframe. A <b>terminal</b> is a device that has a screen and keyboard for input and output, but it does not do its own processing. </p>
	<p>They are used by large firms and government organizations to run their business operations as they can store and process large amounts of data. For example, Banks, universities, and insurance companies use mainframe computers to store the data of their customers, students, and policyholders, respectively.</p>
	<h3>4. Super Computer</h3>
	<br>
	<img src="super comp.jpg" width="500px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
	<p>A supercomputer is mainframe computer that has been optimized for speed and processing power. They have huge storage capacities and computing speeds and thus can perform millions of instructions per second. The super-computers are task-specific and thus used for specialized applications such as large-scale numerical problems in scientific and engineering disciplines including applications in electronics, petroleum engineering, weather forecasting, medicine, space research and more.</p>
	<P>A supercomputer typically costs several million dollars. For example, NASA uses supercomputers for launching space satellites and monitoring and controlling them for space exploration.</P>
	<h3>5. Workstation</h3>
	<br>
	<img src="work comp.jpg" width="500px" height="400px" class="img-fluid">
	<p>A workstation is a powerful, high-end microcomputer. They contain one or more microprocessor CPUs. They may be used by a single-user for applications requiring more power than a typical PC, like; rendering complex graphics, or performing intensive scientific calculations.</p>
	<P>Alternately, workstation microcomputers may be used as server computers that supply files to client computers over a network or the Internet. This class of powerful microcomputers can also be used to handle the processing for many users simultaneously who are connected via terminals. Work stations are generally used for specialized applications such as desktop publishing, software development, and engineering designs.</P>
	<h2>Advantages of computers</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>High speed</h3>
			<p>This is one of the biggest advantages of a computer. At present, computer is not longer just a calculating device. It has very important role in human life. Computer has an incredible speed, which helps human to complete their task in few seconds. It can handle trillions of instructions per second which is really incredible. With its great speed, it can reduce the amount of time to perform any digital task.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Accuracy</h3>
			<p>In addition to being very fast, computers are very accurate. The calculations are 100% error free. Computers perform all jobs with 100% accuracy provided that the input is correct. Computers allows users to perform complex  numerical calculations not only with speed, but also with accuracy.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Storage capability</h3>
			<p>Memory is a very important characteristic of computers. A computer has much more storage capacity than human beings. It can store large amount of data, such as books, films, audio, images, documents, and many other types  of information. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Diligent</h3>
			<p>Unlike human beings, a computer is free from monotony, tiredness, and lack of concentration. It can work continuously without any error and boredom. It can perform repeated tasks with the same speed and accuracy.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Automation</h3>
			<p>Computer is an automatic machine. Automation is the ability to perform a given task automatically. Once the computer receives a program, the program is stored in the computer memory, then the program and instruction can control the program execution without human interaction.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Connects to the Internet</h3>
			<p>It connects you to the internet that allows you to send emails, browse content, gain information, use social media platforms, and more. By connecting to the internet, you can also connect to your long-distance friends and family members.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Data security</h3>
			<p>Protecting digital data is known as data security. Computer provide security from destructive forces and from unwanted action from unauthorized users like cyber attack or access attack.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Reduce paper work and cost</h3>
			<p>The use of computers for data processing in an organization leads to reduction in paper work and results in speeding up the process. As data in electronic files can be retrieved as and when required, the problem of maintenance of large number of paper files gets reduced. Though the initial investment for installing a computer is high, it substantially reduces the cost of each of its transaction.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Keeps you entertained</h3>
			<p> You can use the computer to listen to songs, watch movies, play games and more.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Disadvantages of computers</h2>
